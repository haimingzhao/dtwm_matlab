# dtwm_matlab
Pattern Matching in Time series using a modified version of dynamic time warping. Matlab demo

Proposed algo modified dtw in dtw_m.m
Using test_dtwm.m to test data
See demos

The dtw.m is from MatLab file exchange Quan Wang http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43156-dynamic-time-warping--dtw-

The method proposed in the project is a modification of the classic dtw implementation based on the implemntation mentioned above.
